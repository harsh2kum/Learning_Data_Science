Real-world Example: Multithreading for I/O-bound Tasks
Scenario: Web Scraping 
Web Scrapting often involves making numerous network requests to fetch web
pages. These tasks are I/O-bound because they spend a lot of time waiting 
for responses from serves. Multithreading can significantly improve
the performance by allowing multiple web pages to be fetched concurrently.
